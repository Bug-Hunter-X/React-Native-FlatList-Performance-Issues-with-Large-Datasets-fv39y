This React Native bug manifests when using the FlatList component with a large dataset and complex item render logic.  The issue is that even with optimization techniques like `ItemSeparatorComponent`, `keyExtractor`, and `getItemLayout`, the list becomes extremely sluggish, resulting in noticeable lag and dropped frames during scrolling. This is especially noticeable on lower-end devices or when the network is slow.
